## Annotation

This article delves into the world of blockchain consensus mechanisms, focusing on two innovative approaches: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS). It begins by explaining the significance of consensus mechanisms in the realm of cryptocurrencies and highlights the energy-efficient nature of PoS compared to the traditional Proof of Work (PoW). The article then introduces NPoS, a more democratic variation of PoS that enhances decentralization and fairness. It also explores the essential concept of "sharding," a method designed to improve the scalability and efficiency of blockchain networks.
